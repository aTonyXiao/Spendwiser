# Spendwiser

The SpendWiser application allows a user to manage a digital portfolio of all their credit cards. By specifying which credit cards are in their possession, the SpendWiser application will use  this information along with the phoneâ€™s geolocation to suggest the best credit card to be used at whatever store the user is shopping at.

## Mobile App

Developed in React Native and expo, the mobile application can be deployed on iOS and Android so users can manage their credit card usage with ease.
For more info, please view our user guide.

## Containerized Server

A flexible server architecture was developed so that it can be deployed on any machine that supports Docker.  Utilizing MongoDB and Express flexibility with a secondary Firebase backend was designed in mind.  Security was taken into deep consideration through the use of Javascript Web Tokens and SSL so that authenticated users can only use the database.
